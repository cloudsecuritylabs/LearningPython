#When investing money, an important concept to know is compound interest. The equation FV = PV (1+rate)periods relates the following four quantities.

#The present value (PV) of your money is how much money you have now.
#The future value (FV) of your money is how much money you will have in the future.
#The nominal interest rate per period (rate) is how much interest you earn during a particular length of time, before accounting for compounding. This is typically expressed as a percentage.
#The number of periods (periods) is how many periods in the future this calculation is for.

def future_value(present_value, annual_rate, periods_per_year, years):
    rate_per_period = annual_rate / periods_per_year
    periods = periods_per_year * years
    FV = present_value*(1+rate_per_period)**periods
    return FV





print ("$1000 at 2% compounded daily for 3 years yields $", future_value(1000, .02, 365, 3))
print(future_value(500, .04, 10, 10))
